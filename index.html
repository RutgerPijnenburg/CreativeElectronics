          For this course we worked a lot with electronics, as the name
          suggests, the taught me the basics about how electrical components
          work and how to use them in a system, we had to make a multitude of
          reports and lastly made a prototype to showcase what we had learned in
          the course. In this course I progressed in the making of reports,
          becoming better in writing reports, I also got to work on some
          creativity and aesthetics in the form of the covers I made for these
          reports, lastly the course also allowed me to develop in technology
          and realisation as I am now able to make prototypes that show
          interaction better. Our teamwork mostly went well, we were able to
          clearly divide tasks, each of us working on what we were good at,
          while still allowing improvement, the only thing that went less well
          was my fault, I was sometimes stressing because my teammate was doing
          things last minute, this is something I do more often, as I usually
          like to submit well before the deadline. For next time I can see two
          courses of action, the first would be just trusting that the work will
          be done, and the other would be saying my opinion, this situation will
          occur again which is why I have to choose, in my opinion the second is
          better, however I am currently not able to say my mind like that, so
          for now I will use the first method and I will work on my
          communication in the meantime.
